## Overview

The aim of this project is to use data from the Glassnode API in an attempt to predict the future price of Ethereum 30 days out. Several models were utilized for forecasting including Linear Regression, LSTM, and Facebook Prophet. 

## Business Problem

One of the biggest concerns facing cryptocurrency investors at the moment is that prices are highly volatile due to the large number of factors that can influence them. It is not uncommon to see massive fluctuations within a single day, or in some instances even just a few hours.

Unlike traditional asset classes such as stocks and bonds, the cryptocurrency market is open 24/7. Many cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, are built on open-source blockchain networks. These networks allow users visibility into a number of metrics specifically pertaining to cryptocurrencies that could potentially affect prices. Such metrics include the number of unique wallet addresses, hash rate, as well as Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) to name a few.

The primary audience for this project would be individuals who are looking to invest in this emerging asset class. These models could provide utility to investors by allowing them to have a better understanding of which factors influence price to help guide their investment decisions. 

## Data

The data for this project was collected using the Glassnode API.

## Methods

Describe the process for analyzing or modeling the data. For Phase 1, this will be descriptive analysis.

***
Questions to consider:
* How did you prepare, analyze or model the data?
* Why is this approach appropriate given the data and the business problem?
***

## Results

Present your key results. For Phase 1, this will be findings from your descriptive analysis.

***
Questions to consider:
* How do you interpret the results?
* How confident are you that your results would generalize beyond the data you have?
***

Here is an example of how to embed images from your sub-folder:

## Conclusions

Provide your conclusions about the work you've done, including any limitations or next steps.

***
Questions to consider:
* What would you recommend the business do as a result of this work?
* What are some reasons why your analysis might not fully solve the business problem?
* What else could you do in the future to improve this project?
